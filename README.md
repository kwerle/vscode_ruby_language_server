# vscode_ruby_language_server

vscode_ruby_language_server is a plugin for Visual Studio Code to run the language server https://github.com/kwerle/ruby_language_server .

## Requirements

You must have [docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) installed (and running).  I hear you asking why.  Because I don't install a development environment any more - just docker.  And it takes care of all the requirements, consistency, etc.  No platform issues.  No library issues (other than what is brought with).

## Status

This is alpha software.  I will be using it every day, so it ought to work.

## Credit

This started as a copy of https://github.com/mtsmfm/vscode-ruby-lsc .  Thanks to Fumiaki MATSUSHIMA for the work.  He deserves none of the blame.
